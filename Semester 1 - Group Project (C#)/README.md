Student Housing - Software Project Semester 1

Participants - Kristiyan Balev, Stanislav Petkov, Stefan Pricopi, Stefan Popescu 

Description - A small windows form application, which goal is to provide better communication between students in rented housing spaces in the Netherlands.
The application is capable of creating new agreements, rules, events, users and filing complaints. It's based on Object-oriented programming and most of the code is based on the theory material studied in Semester 1 at Fontys University of Applied Science.

**The application should always be running in 150% Display Scaling, otherwise the design messes up!!!**
